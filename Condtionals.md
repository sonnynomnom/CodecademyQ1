##### Python

1. Go With the Flow

```python
def clinic():
    print "You've just entered the clinic!"
    print "Do you take the door on the left or the right?"
    answer = raw_input("Type left or right and hit 'Enter'.").lower()
    if answer == "left" or answer == "l":
        print "This is the Verbal Abuse Room, you heap of parrot droppings!"
    elif answer == "right" or answer == "r":
        print "Of course this is the Argument Room, I've told you that already!"
    else:
        print "You didn't pick left or right! Try again."
        clinic()

clinic()
```

2. Compare Closely!

Comparators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

```python
# Assign True or False as appropriate on the lines below!

# Set this to True if 17 < 328 or to False if it is not.
bool_one = True   # We did this one for you!

# Set this to True if 100 == (2 * 50) or to False otherwise.
bool_two = True

# Set this to True if 19 <= 19 or to False if it is not.
bool_three = True

# Set this to True if -22 >= -18 or to False if it is not.
bool_four = False

# Set this to True if 99 != (98 + 1) or to False otherwise.
bool_five = False
```

3. Compare... Closelier!
```python
# Assign True or False as appropriate on the lines below!

# (20 - 10) > 15
bool_one = False    # We did this one for you!

# (10 + 17) == 3**16
# Remember that ** can be read as 'to the power of'. 3**16 is about 43 million.
bool_two = False

# 1**2 <= -1
bool_three = False

# 40 * 4 >= -4
bool_four = True

# 100 != 10**2
bool_five = False
```

4. How the Tables Have Turned
```python
# Create comparative statements as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me true!
bool_one = 3 < 5  # We already did this one for you!

# Make me false!
bool_two = 3 > 5

# Make me true!
bool_three = 8 == 8

# Make me false!
bool_four = 8 < 7

# Make me true!
bool_five = 8 != 7
```

5. To Be and/or Not to Be

- `and`, `or`, `not`

```python
"""
     Boolean Operators
------------------------      
True and True is True
True and False is False
False and True is False
False and False is False

True or True is True
True or False is True
False or True is True
False or False is False

Not True is False
Not False is True

"""
```

6. And

```python
bool_one = False and False

bool_two = False and True

bool_three = True and False

bool_four = True and True

bool_five = True and True
```

7. Or

```python
bool_one = 2**3 == 108 % 100 or 'Cleese' == 'King Arthur'

bool_two = True or False

bool_three = 100**0.5 >= 50 or False

bool_four = True or True

bool_five = 1**100 == 100**1 or 3 * 2 * 1 != 3 + 2 + 1
```

8. Not

```python
bool_one = not True

bool_two = not 3**4 < 4**3

bool_three = not 10 % 3 <= 10 % 2

bool_four = not 3**2 + 4**2 != 5**2

bool_five = not not False
```
